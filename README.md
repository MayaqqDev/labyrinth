## `Information`

A server-side mod that adds new weapons and a new custom crafting (forging) system!

To make almost anything in this mod, you need to create the forge. The forge can be created by placing an anvil on Iron/Gold/Diamond/Netherite block, then it will show a preview for how to build the forge. The tools will be made from the material same as the block below the anvil.

This mod currently adds bunch of weapons in all ore types and a few utility weapons and tools. You can see them all by looking into the forge.

If you want to see the custom textures, you need to generate the polymer resource pack and add it.
